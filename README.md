## Lab 1

### App Description
First version of a Flashcards app that is used to study. The app presents a question card and separate answer options. If the correct answer is chosen, the main question card reveals the answer, which should be the same as the selected choice. If incorrect, the selected choice disappears, and the main question card remains intact.
